# BRUTE FORCE ATTACK
simulation of a brute force attack using multi processing 
implemented with a python command script and with both python and C test servers and subprocesses

with 4 cores, a decimal password of length 8 (23622295), and a test server implemented in C
	(note the first 4 cores/subprocesses start from 1,2,3,4 respectively, so core 2 will succeed with (23622295))
	C: 226s
	py: 210s
